## 📘 Introduction
**CodexGraph Agent** is an advanced multi-tasking agent that integrates a language model (LM) agent with a code graph database interface. By utilizing the structural characteristics of graph databases and the versatility of the Cypher query language, CodexGraph enables the LM agent to formulate and execute multi-step queries. This capability allows for precise context retrieval and code navigation that is aware of the code's structure.

## 🚀 How to Use
### 1️⃣ Set Up the Python Environment
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Build the graph database environment:
Create a separate `Python 3.7` environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r build_requirements.txt
```
## 2️⃣ Locate the Graph Database Environment
- Find the Python path:
```bash
where python
```
## 3️⃣ Run CodexGraph Agent
- Navigate to the modelscope-agent directory:
```bash
cd modelscope-agent
```
- Run the CodexGraph Agent:
```bash
python apps\codexgraph_agent\run.py
```
